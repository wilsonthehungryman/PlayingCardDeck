CardDeck

A simple data structure that represents a deck of cards. The goal is to use this project in a couple of card games (hence generics and inheritance). Hearts being the first target. I'm mainly doing this for experience, and a chance to create an AI.

CardDeck is intended to be inherited for specific types of decks.

A Deck consists of Cards or a Card subclass.
